Impact of The Project:

With the use of the above-mentioned dataset, we aim to analyze and perform predictions and thus gain hidden insights on wildfires across the United States of America. The analysis would include various parameters of the wildfire and help observe the trend of its geographical occurrence.

4. Analysis and Results
Some of the insights based on the analysis made are:

Fig: 4.1 Geographical mapping of hotspots of wildfires

• This geographical mapping of the hotspots of wildfires (Fig: 4.1) shows region in and around Alaska as a major hotspot since more than three wildfires occur on the same convergence of longitude and latitude.

• From the pie chart (Fig: 4.2) representing the days of fire and no fire occurred in the span of 1992 – 2015, it can be inferred that in 23 years, out of 8760 days, 6068 days have had fire, accounting to 68 percent of the total wildfire occurred.

• The barplot depicting the highest frequency of wildfires by state (Fig: 4.3) shows Alaska, Oregon, and Idaho as the three most highly impacted states with a fire size of 600000, 550000, and 470000 respectively.

Fig: 4.4 Frequency of wildfire with different size classes

• From the barplot showing frequency of wildfires occurred having different fire sizes (Fig: 4.4), classes A, B and C with respective fire sizes are commonly reported and classes E, F and G are the three least reported classes.

 Fig: 4.5 Count of wildfires occurred over the years
 
• The representation of count of wildfires occurred over the years (Fig: 4.5) shows 1993 as the year with the least number of fires reported and just the next year, 1992, has had the highest fires reported with a count of 13954 fires in the span of 23 years.
